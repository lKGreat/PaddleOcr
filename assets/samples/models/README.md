# CI-fast model stubs

These files are lightweight placeholders for CI-fast command smoke checks.

- They are used for command contract checks (`config check`, `doctor check-models`).
- They are not valid ONNX binaries and are not intended for real inference.
- Real benchmark/inference pipelines should replace them with actual model files.
